# Project_Cpp

This respository is intended to store the projects implemented in C++. Moreover, some OpenCV projects will be preferably implmented with C++ and also included in this respository. Since I have taken several C++ courses, it is nearly the most familiar programming language and to be honest, it is almost my favorite programming language.
