# PROJECT LOG

This is the log of the project from MSc dissertation of a master. The basic description of the project is as follows.

"One of the emerging problems with digital asset management is how to link records and information held in the digital asset to what workers require in the field to carry out operation and maintenance tasks. Using depth measurements from the Microsoft Kinect sensor and a 3-dimensional model of a room, the main problem will be to identify the geometric position and orientation of the sensor's viewpoint."

The whole project will be separated into several phases, which would accomplish individual functionality.

A folder was added as the Phase 1 of Kinect project, which accomplishes to measure the center point's distance. Further work will be incremented as the project proceeds.

A folder was added as the Phase 2 of Kinect project, which accomplishes Correspondence Grouping Algorithm with aid of recognition module inside PCL (Point Cloud Library). This phase basically completes the most difficult part in the project and general process was adjusted due to this algorithm.

A folder was added as the Phase 3 of Kinect project, which implements Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm as counterpart of previous phase's algorithm. However, the exact accomplishment is not quite satisfatory when pcd files are large and complex.
