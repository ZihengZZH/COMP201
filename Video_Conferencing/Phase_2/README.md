# Phase 2 (Camera calibration)

This phase is designed to calibrate a camera, which may be instrincally distorted by poor-quality lens. Using three types of objects, black-white chessboard, symmetrical circle pattern and asymmetrical circle pattern, the distortion coefficients can be obtained. To every camera, the distortion coefficient is different and its exact parameters will be saved into an XML file. The detailed explanation refers to document "Camera Calibration with OpenCV".
