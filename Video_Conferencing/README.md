# Direct Eye-contact Video Conferencing

In most video conferencing systems, the camera is placed to the side ot above the screen, whilst people tend to look at the centre of the screen rather than the camera. Hence the participants in the video conferencing cannot eye-contact and in other words, they are not looking at each other. However, eye-contact is one of the most significant elements of verbal communcation.

The project is intended to implement a software to generate a video stream in which people (video conferencing participants) appear to be looking straight into the camera.
