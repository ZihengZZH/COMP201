# Direct Eye-contact Video Conferencing

In most video conferencing systems, the camera is placed to the side ot above the screen, whilst people tend to look at the centre of the screen rather than the camera. Hence the participants in the video conferencing cannot perceive eye-contact and in other words, they are not looking at each other. However, eye-contact is one of the most significant elements of verbal communcation. So it is necessary and urgent to address this problem.

The project is intended to implement a software to generate a video stream in which people (video conferencing participants) appear to be looking straight into the camera. This objective is realisable through a well-defined procedure as follows. There will be a setup of two identical web-cameras that is horizontally settled above the screen. Both web-cameras will be calibrated with a classic black-white chessboard in OpenCV and camera parameters will be determined simultaneously. According to images from two calibrated web-cameras, a disparity map can be produced. Then 3D information can be obtained to output depth image or point cloud. The resulting depeth information is then used to render a synthesised view at a position in the centre where the participant is looking at.
