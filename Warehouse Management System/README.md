This is a group project to design and to implement a Warehouse Management System in C++, completed by five members. The management system should hold the information of warehouse and all its container, and also record every good stored in the warehouse. Customers should be able to check in, search, check out and amend their goods and the Keeper, who owns the highest authority, should be able to manage this warehouse and customersâ€™ information.
